### People who taught me the most

- [Tim Buchalka (Learn Programming Academy)](https://www.timbuchalka.com/)
  - A great, 40 years experienced Australian guy. 
  - I recommend his course [Java 17 Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wdq3@5-6JiX32tqcqFrblDvGj75-uqlBJHKzzRqfpuTf-gqVUfoWKToKZoyyQxE_eS-ClGw==/)
  <br>
  It's a pity that the older version of the linked course is no longer available - it was humorous :)
  <br><br>
  
- [Navin Reddy (Telusko)](https://telusko.com/) 
  - For me, this Indian friend explains the concepts in the most understandable way.
  <br><br>

  - Kawał porządnej, polskiej roboty w wykonaniu Mateusza
    <br><br>

  - Also, a good approach to explain stuff.

    <br><br>
